# horiseonChallenge

This is the submission README file for the Horiseon Challenge - Module 1 for UCF Boot Camp.

# The link to the page:
[gracekevin.github.io/horiseonChallenge](https://gracekevin.github.io/horiseonChallenge/)

The completed webpage contains updated linking for the .css file and index.html file. The hardest part of this process was getting the file to publish using Git Pages. I was finally able to work through having to remove the files from the folder included in the original source code.


## Here is what the site will look like once loaded to a browser
